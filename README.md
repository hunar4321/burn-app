# Burn APP

Calculates the total body surface area of the burn according to the rule of 9. It also calculates the total fluid replacement needed for the patient if necessary.

Note: I made this program as a hobby when I was first learning about programming. Back then I used to work as a junior doctor at a hospital (10 years ago when visual basic was the mainstream!). 
Managing burn cases might be different from one hospital to another but they all require to estimate the burned area first. Accurate estimation is essential for a proper management. I'm not maintaining the program as I actually forgot visual basic! The program is not used currently and shouldn't be used without proper testing but I'm still opensourcing the program in case anyone was interested in the idea and wanted to take it fruther or to be inspired and make a better one in another language.
